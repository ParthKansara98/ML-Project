# Diabetes Detection Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to detect and predict diabetes based on relevant health metrics. The system analyzes patient data to provide early detection of diabetes, potentially enabling timely medical intervention.

## Features
-   Data preprocessing and cleaning
-   Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
-   Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms
-   Model comparison and evaluation
-   User-friendly interface for prediction

## Dataset
The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains several health predictor variables and one target variable (diabetes diagnosis). The dataset includes information such as:

-   Pregnancies
-   Glucose
-   Blood Pressure
-   Skin Thickness
-   Insulin
-   BMI
-   Diabetes Pedigree Function
-   Age
-   Outcome (diabetic/non-diabetic)

## Technologies Used
-   Python 3.x
-   Scikit-learn
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
-   Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
-   Random Forest Classifier


## Installation and Setup

3. Install the required packages:
4. Run Jupyter Notebook:

## Usage
1. Open the main notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the step-by-step process documented in the notebook.
3. To make predictions on new data, use the trained model through the provided functions or interface.

## Results
-   Achieved 78-85% accuracy in diabetes prediction
-   Identified key features influencing diabetes diagnosis
-   Generated visualizations showing the relationship between health metrics and diabetes risk

## Future Improvements
